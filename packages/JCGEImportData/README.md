# JCGEImportData

Import utilities that extract data from external sources (e.g., GTAP, Eurostat)
and emit canonical JCGE CSV datasets for model calibration.

Scope:
- ETL from external datasets into the canonical schema.
- No model-specific logic (writes files under a model data directory).
 - Canonical schema is defined in `packages/JCGECalibrate/README.md`.

Status: stub package (no API yet).
