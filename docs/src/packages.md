# Packages

This project is organized as a set of focused Julia packages. The table below
summarizes responsibilities and typical usage.

| Package | Purpose | Typical Use |
|---|---|---|
| `JCGECore` | RunSpec, sections, sets/mappings, scenarios, validation | Define model structure and constraints |
| `JCGEBlocks` | Reusable CGE blocks | Assemble production/household/market systems |
| `JCGERuntime` | Compilation and solver execution | Solve a RunSpec with Ipopt/PATH |
| `JCGECalibrate` | SAM loading and calibration | Derive parameters and starting values |
| `JCGEOutput` | Rendering and results containers | Export equations, tidy results, DualSignals |
| `JCGEExamples` | Reference models | Canonical model ports and tests |
| `JCGEImportData` | Canonical IO/SAM schema | Convert external data to CSV inputs |
| `JCGEImportMPSGE` | MPSGE.jl importer | Translate MPSGE objects to RunSpecs |
| `JCGEAgentInterface` | MCP-compatible interface for agents | Tooling for AI integrations |

Each package has its own documentation site and API reference. This repository
keeps the ecosystem narrative consistent, but package-specific details belong in
those package docs.
