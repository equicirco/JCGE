# Packages

This project is organized as a set of focused Julia packages. The table below
summarizes responsibilities and typical usage.

| Package | Purpose | Typical Use |
|---|---|---|
| `JCGECore` | RunSpec, sections, sets/mappings, scenarios, validation, and closure-condition roles | Define model structure and closure choices |
| `JCGEBlocks` | Reusable CGE blocks, auxiliary-quantity equations, and stable equation-condition keys | Assemble production/household/market systems, make supplementary quantities endogenous, and declare accounting checks |
| `JCGERuntime` | Role-aware compilation, solver execution, residual diagnostics, and experiment workflows | Solve a RunSpec and run parameter/policy batches |
| `JCGECalibrate` | SAM loading and calibration | Derive parameters and starting values |
| `JCGEOutput` | Equation rendering, results containers, accounting-check reporting, and satellite quantities | Export equations, tidy results, physical-flow projections, balance checks, and DualSignals |
| `JCGEExamples` | Reference models | Canonical model ports and tests |
| `JCGEImportData` | Canonical IO/SAM schema | Convert external data to CSV inputs |
| `JCGEImportMPSGE` | MPSGE.jl importer | Translate MPSGE objects to RunSpecs |
| `JCGEAgentInterface` | MCP-compatible interface for agents | AI-assisted discovery, modeling guidance, solving, validation, and reporting |

Each package has its own documentation site and API reference. This repository
keeps the ecosystem narrative consistent, but package-specific details belong in
those package docs.

For agent-based use, see the [AI Agent Interface guide](guides/agents.md). The
released MCP server is registered as `io.github.equicirco/JCGEAgentInterface.jl`
and the container image is published as
`ghcr.io/equicirco/jcge-agentinterface-mcp:<release-version>`.
