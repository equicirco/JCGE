# Project

JCGE is a multi-package Julia ecosystem for computable general equilibrium (CGE)
modeling. It favors small, focused packages with clear responsibilities over a
single monolith. This repo provides the cross-cutting narrative: how the ecosystem
fits together, how to model with it, and where to find the right package for a task.

## Goals

- Make CGE model structure explicit and composable.
- Separate calibration, modeling, runtime, and reporting concerns.
- Provide reusable building blocks that scale from simple to large models.
- Keep the ecosystem approachable for applied economists and data teams.

## Scope of this documentation website

- Framework architecture and workflows (see the [Guides](guides/modeling.md))
- Cross-package guides and examples (start with [Getting Started](getting-started.md))
- High-level package responsibilities (see [Packages](packages.md))

## Ecosystem map

The JCGE ecosystem is built as a set of focused packages that connect through shared
data structures and explicit interfaces:

- Core abstractions and schemas live in `JCGECore`.
- Reusable economic blocks and domain-neutral auxiliary-quantity equations are
  defined in `JCGEBlocks`.
- Model execution, solver orchestration, and generic experiment workflows run
  through `JCGERuntime`.
- Calibration workflows live in `JCGECalibrate`.
- Reporting, export, and baseline-referenced satellite quantities live in
  `JCGEOutput`.
- Reference models and end-to-end examples live in `JCGEExamples`.
- Data ingestion is handled by `JCGEImportData` and `JCGEImportMPSGE`.

## Design principles

- Modularity over monoliths.
- Explicit data schemas and traceable transformations.
- Separation between model structure, calibration, runtime, and reporting.
- Physical quantities represented consistently through calibrated anchors,
  solved baseline references, and explicitly declared units.
- Reproducible workflows that scale from small to large models.
- Clear boundaries between packages with stable interfaces.

## Workflow overview

1. Define model structure and blocks ([Modeling](guides/modeling.md)).
2. Calibrate parameters and data to the canonical schema ([Calibration](guides/calibration.md)).
3. Run models through the runtime and solver integration ([Running](guides/running.md)).
4. Generate outputs, reports, and exports ([Output](guides/output.md)).

See the [Guides](guides/modeling.md) section for detailed steps across each stage.

## How this approach differs

Many CGE systems are delivered as closed or tightly coupled toolchains. JCGE takes a
different path: open, composable, and inspectable building blocks that can be reused
across models and institutions.

- Open source and fully inspectable from data ingest to solver interface.
- Reusable blocks that can be recomposed instead of copied between models.
- Free and open access documentation with modern tooling.
- Scientific rigor through explicit data schemas and reproducible workflows.
- Performance-oriented Julia implementation for fast iteration.
- Accessible workflows, including integration with AI-assisted tooling.

## Who this is for

- Applied economists and policy modeling teams.
- Research groups that need transparent, inspectable models.
- Organizations that want reusable components instead of single-use scripts.
- Students and educators building modern CGE workflows.
