# Running Models

This guide covers how to run models, configure solvers, and work with scenarios.
For structural modeling steps, see the [Modeling guide](modeling.md).

The `JCGEExamples` package provides reference models ported from the literature.
Each model exposes a `model`, `baseline`, and `solve` entry point.

```julia
using JCGEExamples

result = JCGEExamples.StandardCGE.solve()
```

## Build a spec and run it

You can also run a custom `RunSpec` directly once it is validated:

```julia
using JCGERuntime, Ipopt

report = validate_model(spec)
report.ok || error("Model validation failed")

result = run!(spec; optimizer=Ipopt.Optimizer)
```

`run!` compiles the closure conditions marked `:enforce` and evaluates any
conditions marked `:accounting_check` after solution. The latter remain in the
equation inventory but are not supplied to the solver. See
[Closures & Checks](closures.md) for setup and residual inspection.

## Solvers

- NLP models: Ipopt (`Ipopt.Optimizer`)
- MCP models: PATHSolver (`PATHSolver.Optimizer`)

PATHSolver requires a license for larger problems. You can provide the license
via environment variable:

```bash
export PATH_LICENSE_STRING="<LICENSE STRING>"
```

If the problem is small enough, PATHSolver can run without a license.

## Runtime options

Typical runtime controls include:

- Choice of optimizer and solver parameters.
- Output directories and report formats.
- Scenario labels for comparison workflows.

Exact options depend on the runtime package entry points you use.

## Scenarios and experiments

Run the same model under multiple parameter sets to compare outcomes. A common
workflow is to:

1. Define a baseline calibration.
2. Apply policy or shock parameters.
3. Solve and compare outputs.

Use consistent naming for scenarios to make reports reproducible.

Generic batch mechanics for parameter grids, policy grids, reference comparisons,
frontier selection, sensitivity screens, and closure checks live in
`JCGERuntime.Experiments`. Model packages remain responsible for their own model
builders, indicators, and interpretation of results.

Starting with `JCGERuntime` v0.1.2, independent experiment grids can also use
process-based distributed execution:

```julia
records = JCGERuntime.Experiments.run_grid(specs;
    runner = run_experiment,
    execution = :distributed,
    workers = 8,
    worker_modules = [:MyModelPackage],
)
```

Serial execution remains the default. The distributed mode is meant for
parameter-space and policy-grid exploration where each experiment can be solved
independently.

## Troubleshooting

- Check validation reports before solving.
- Confirm that all calibration outputs map to block parameters.
- For PATHSolver issues, confirm the license string and solver availability.
