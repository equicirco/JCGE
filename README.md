JCGE.jl is a modular, block-based framework for building and running computable general equilibrium (CGE) models in Julia.

## Repository layout
- `packages/`: independently testable Julia packages
  - `JCGECore`: canonical data model and interfaces (no JuMP)
  - `JCGECalibrate`: calibration utilities for standard functional forms (no JuMP)
  - `JCGERuntime`: JuMP-facing runtime (model building, closure, diagnostics)
  - `JCGEBlocks`: standard CGE blocks built on the interfaces
  - `JCGEOutput`: equation rendering and results/IO reporting utilities
  - `JCGEAgentInterface`: MCP passthrough for AI agent usage
  - `JCGEImportMPSGE`: converter from MPSGE.jl model objects into blocks
  - `JCGEExamples`: runnable reference models and scenarios
- `docs/`: documentation sources (optional)
- `scripts/`: developer utilities (optional)
- `data/`: tiny toy datasets only (no large/proprietary files)

## Solvers
- NLP: Ipopt (via JuMP)
- MCP: PATH (via PATHSolver.jl; runs without a license for small problems, license required for larger ones: https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ferris/path.html)

## Status
Pre-release. APIs are unstable until a tagged v0.1.
